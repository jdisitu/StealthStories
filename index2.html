            I was the very last parent to pick up my son from kindergarden that
            day. We have struggled financially for a few years since the
            hospital bills for my mom have been pretty rough. I don’t know how a
            kindergarden got hold of such an expensive piece of decoration, but
            on the wall in the main dining room hang an Arne Jacobsen clock
            worth around 200 dollars. To be honest I don’t know why I did it,
            because a clock will not make a huge difference in our lives, but as
            we were about to leave, I quickly climbed up on a table of took the
            clock under my jacket and left.
