        <p>I was the very last parent to pick up my son from kindergarden that day. We have struggled financially for a few years since the hospital bills for my mom have been pretty rough. I don’t know how a kindergarden got hold of such an expensive piece of decoration, but on the wall in the main dining room hang an Arne Jacobsen clock worth around 200 dollars. To be honest I don’t know why I did it, because a clock will not make a huge difference in our lives, but as we were about to leave, I quickly climbed up on a table of took the clock under my jacket and left. I told my wife that I found it cheap on a yardsale, and wanted it to decorate our tiny home - she was extremely happy for it. The next time I picked up my son, they had replaced the clock with a cheap one from IKEA, but I never heard anyone speak of it.</p>
